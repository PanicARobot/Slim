Slim strategy description

This file goal is to define the behavior of the robot during a combat.

Inputs:
1. Motor measured speed left and right (RPM)
2. Distance sensor left and right (active / not active)
3. Oiler angles defined orientation (deg)
4. Orientation in quaternions (quaternions)
5. Acceleration of the robot in 3D (m/s^2)
6. Angular speed of the robot (deg/s^2)
7. Tire traction available, left and right (available / not available)
8. TODO

Outputs:
1. Motor set point speed, left and right (RPM)
2. TODO

States:
1. Initial state - the moment after the start signal was applied.
    General approach is to start going trough the terrain in a pattern, pattern is TODO.

2. Contact waiting state
    We need to detect contact event (TODO - how to distinguish contact).
    We need to control position changing using the pattern decided in the previous state (TODO, maybe PID control of path travelled by every tire).

2. Contact detected state
    Once contact is detected we need to decide action (TODO).
    Different contacts must have different actions (TODO).

3. Action tracking state
    Once the opponent position is known and the counter action is chosen we need to make sure the action is done properly.
    Here we need to watch out for disposition problems like lifting us up while trying to push the opponent on the front.

4. OPTIONAL Action failure state
    The action has failed in execution (TODO definition of action failure).
    New action is to be chosen and passed to execution.
