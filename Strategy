Slim strategy description

This file goal is to clear the behavior of the robot during a combat.

Inputs:
1. Motor measured speed left and right (RPM)
2. Distance sensor left and right (active / not active)
3. Oiler angles defined orientation (deg)
4. Acceleration of the robot in 3D (m/s^2)
5. Tire traction available, left and right (available / not available)
6. TODO

Outputs:
1. Motor set point speed, left and right (RPM)
2. TODO

Modes:
1. Initial - the moment after the start signal was applied.
    Here a searching strategy is needed.
    Here contact definition is needed.

2. After contact decision taking
    Once the opponent position is available we need to take action, this happens here.
    We need to have different decisions based on type of contact with opponent.

3. Executing counter measure
    Once the opponent position is known and the counter measure is chosen we need to make sure the measure is done properly.
    Here we need to watch out for disposition problems like lifting us up while trying to push the opponent on the front.

4. Optional Counter measure failure
    The counter measure has failed in execution, we need to make a new decision on how to proceed. (we go back to step 3 afterwards)
